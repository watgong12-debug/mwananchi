- Password: 125050.Lit

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to `/auth` and sign up with the phone number and password above
2. After signing up, let me know so I can add the admin role to your account

**Admin Access:**
Once the admin role is added, you'll be able to access:

- `/admin/applications` - Manage loan applications (approve/reject)

Regular users will only see their own dashboard without support requests.
